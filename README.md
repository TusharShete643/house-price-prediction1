Linear regression is a statistical method that can be used to predict the value of a continuous variable, such as house prices. 
In a linear regression model, the relationship between the independent variables (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location) and the dependent variable (house price) is represented by a linear equation. By analyzing historical data on house prices and their associated independent variables, the model can be trained to predict the value of a house given a set of independent variables. This can be done by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, known as the residual sum of squares. Once trained, the model can be used to predict the value of new houses for which only the independent variables are known.
